# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Completed frontend PBAC integration
- Removed all role-based UI checks and conditional rendering
- Updated components to rely on backend permission enforcement
- Simplified frontend authorization logic

## Recent Changes
1. Frontend PBAC Integration:
   - Removed AdminRoute component and role-based route protection
   - Updated AuthContext to store complete user data
   - Removed role-based UI conditionals from Navbar and AdminLayout
   - Updated OrderCreatePage to use permission-based filtering
   - Simplified frontend authorization by relying on backend permission checks
2. Backend: Fuel Order Service Enhancement (Aircraft Auto-Creation) - 2025-05-07
   - Modified `FuelOrderService.create_fuel_order` to automatically create `Aircraft` records if the provided `tail_number` doesn't exist.
   - New aircraft are created with placeholder values: `aircraft_type="UNKNOWN_TYPE"`, `fuel_type="UNKNOWN_FUEL"`.
   - This change resolves the `ForeignKeyViolation` previously encountered when creating fuel orders for new aircraft.
   - Service method return signature updated to a 4-tuple including an `aircraft_created_flag`.
3. Backend: Fuel Order Route Enhancement (`fuel_order_routes.py`) - 2025-05-08
   - Modified the `create_fuel_order` route function.
   - Implemented auto-assignment for `assigned_truck_id` if `-1` is provided by the client (selects first available active truck).
   - Enhanced validation for `requested_amount`: must be a positive float, with robust type conversion.
   - Improved validation for `assigned_lst_user_id` and `assigned_truck_id` to allow specific auto-assign values (`-1`) or positive IDs.
   - Added checks to ensure required string fields are not empty.

## Current State
- Backend enforces authorization via granular permissions
- Frontend no longer performs role-based access control
- UI components rely on backend 403 responses for unauthorized actions
- Navigation and UI elements are shown/hidden based on backend permissions
- Fuel order creation (`FuelOrderService.create_fuel_order`) now transparently handles aircraft creation for unknown tail numbers, preventing `ForeignKeyViolation` errors for this scenario.
- Fuel order creation route (`create_fuel_order` in `fuel_order_routes.py`) now supports auto-assignment of fuel trucks and has more robust input validation for `requested_amount`, `assigned_lst_user_id`, and `assigned_truck_id`.

## Next Steps
1. Test fuel order creation with LST and Truck auto-assignment (`assigned_lst_user_id: -1`, `assigned_truck_id: -1`).
2. Test fuel order creation with various valid/invalid `requested_amount` values.
3. Test all admin routes to ensure proper handling of 403 responses
4. Verify error message display for unauthorized actions
5. Update user documentation to reflect the new permission-based system
6. Consider implementing frontend permission caching if needed for performance

## Known Issues
- Previously: Potential `ForeignKeyViolation` in `FuelOrderService.create_fuel_order` if `tail_number` did not exist in `aircraft` table. (RESOLVED by auto-creation feature - 2025-05-07)
- (Review for any other current known issues)

## Dependencies
- Backend PBAC implementation complete and functional
- Frontend error handling system in place for 403 responses

## Current Status

### PBAC Frontend Implementation (Phase 4)
- Completed Role Management UI implementation:
  - Created API services for roles and permissions
  - Built reusable components for role management:
    - RoleTable: List and manage roles
    - RoleForm: Create/edit role details
    - RolePermissionManager: Assign/remove permissions
  - Implemented RoleManagementPage with full functionality:
    - Role CRUD operations
    - Permission assignment/removal
    - Error handling and loading states
  - Added navigation and routing:
    - New /admin/roles route
    - Sidebar and tab navigation
    - Integration with existing admin layout
- Next focus: User-Role Assignment UI implementation
  - Will extend UserManagementPage
  - Need to integrate with role assignment endpoints

### Previous Milestones

### PBAC Migration Script Verification
- Completed verification of PBAC migration script (05eadf8716a5)
- Confirmed correct implementation of:
  - Permission seeding (21 permissions)
  - Role creation and permission assignments
  - User role migration
- No discrepancies found in the implementation
- Migration logic handles edge cases appropriately
- Operations are performed in correct order
