# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Completed frontend PBAC integration
- Removed all role-based UI checks and conditional rendering
- Updated components to rely on backend permission enforcement
- Simplified frontend authorization logic

## Recent Changes
1. Frontend PBAC Integration:
   - Removed AdminRoute component and role-based route protection
   - Updated AuthContext to store complete user data
   - Removed role-based UI conditionals from Navbar and AdminLayout
   - Updated OrderCreatePage to use permission-based filtering
   - Simplified frontend authorization by relying on backend permission checks

## Current State
- Backend enforces authorization via granular permissions
- Frontend no longer performs role-based access control
- UI components rely on backend 403 responses for unauthorized actions
- Navigation and UI elements are shown/hidden based on backend permissions

## Next Steps
1. Test all admin routes to ensure proper handling of 403 responses
2. Verify error message display for unauthorized actions
3. Update user documentation to reflect the new permission-based system
4. Consider implementing frontend permission caching if needed for performance

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Dependencies
- Backend PBAC implementation complete and functional
- Frontend error handling system in place for 403 responses

## Current Status

### PBAC Frontend Implementation (Phase 4)
- Completed Role Management UI implementation:
  - Created API services for roles and permissions
  - Built reusable components for role management:
    - RoleTable: List and manage roles
    - RoleForm: Create/edit role details
    - RolePermissionManager: Assign/remove permissions
  - Implemented RoleManagementPage with full functionality:
    - Role CRUD operations
    - Permission assignment/removal
    - Error handling and loading states
  - Added navigation and routing:
    - New /admin/roles route
    - Sidebar and tab navigation
    - Integration with existing admin layout
- Next focus: User-Role Assignment UI implementation
  - Will extend UserManagementPage
  - Need to integrate with role assignment endpoints

### Previous Milestones

### PBAC Migration Script Verification
- Completed verification of PBAC migration script (05eadf8716a5)
- Confirmed correct implementation of:
  - Permission seeding (21 permissions)
  - Role creation and permission assignments
  - User role migration
- No discrepancies found in the implementation
- Migration logic handles edge cases appropriately
- Operations are performed in correct order
