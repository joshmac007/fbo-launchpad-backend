# Tasks Plan

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 4: Frontend PBAC Integration
  - [x] Step 1: Update Admin UI components for PBAC
  - [x] Step 2: Implement permission-based UI rendering
  - [x] Step 3: Update route protection
  - [x] Step 4: Remove legacy role-based checks
    - [x] Remove AdminRoute component
    - [x] Update AuthContext to store complete user data
    - [x] Remove role-based UI conditionals
    - [x] Update API calls to use permission-based filtering
- [x] Backend: Fuel Order Service - Auto-create Aircraft
  - [x] Modified `FuelOrderService.create_fuel_order` to automatically create a new `Aircraft` record if the provided `tail_number` does not exist.
  - [x] Uses placeholders "UNKNOWN_TYPE" for `aircraft_type` and "UNKNOWN_FUEL" for `fuel_type` for auto-created aircraft.
  - [x] Updated service method return signature and all return paths to a 4-tuple `(instance | None, message | None, status_code | None, aircraft_created_flag | None)`.
  - [x] Resolved `ForeignKeyViolation` for `tail_number` when creating fuel orders for new aircraft.

## Current Tasks
- [x] Backend: Fuel Order Creation - Implement Truck Auto-Assignment and Robust Validation (2025-05-08)
  - [x] Modified `fuel_order_routes.py` in `create_fuel_order` function.
  - [x] Added logic to auto-assign `assigned_truck_id` if `-1` is provided.
  - [x] Implemented robust validation for `requested_amount` (must be positive float).
  - [x] Improved validation for `assigned_lst_user_id` and `assigned_truck_id` to allow `-1` or positive IDs.
  - [x] Added checks for empty strings in required string fields.
- [ ] Testing and Validation
  - [ ] Test admin routes for proper 403 handling
  - [ ] Verify error message display
  - [ ] Update user documentation

## Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Performance Optimization
  - [ ] Consider implementing frontend permission caching
  - [ ] Optimize API calls for permission checks

## Backlog
- [ ] User documentation updates
- [ ] System monitoring implementation
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

### PBAC Implementation (Phase 4)
- [x] Step 1: Implement Admin Role Management UI
  - [x] Created RoleService and PermissionService for API integration
  - [x] Implemented RoleTable, RoleForm, and RolePermissionManager components
  - [x] Created RoleManagementPage with full CRUD and permission management
  - [x] Added routing and navigation in AdminLayout
  - Result: Complete role management interface with permission assignment capabilities

### Next Steps
- [ ] Step 2: Implement User-Role Assignment UI
  - [ ] Create UserRoleManager component
  - [ ] Update UserManagementPage to include role assignments
  - [ ] Integrate with backend role assignment endpoints

### Completed Tasks

### Pytest Fix Plan (Phase 1)
- [x] Step 3: Verify PBAC migration script implementation
  - [x] Analyzed permission seeding logic
  - [x] Verified role creation and permission assignments
  - [x] Confirmed user role migration process
  - [x] Validated operation order and edge case handling
  - Result: All implementations correct, no fixes needed
