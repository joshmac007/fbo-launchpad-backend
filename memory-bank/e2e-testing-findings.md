# E2E Testing Findings for FBO LaunchPad

## Overview

This document outlines the findings, issues, and recommendations from end-to-end testing using Playwright for the FBO LaunchPad application, with a focus on the Fuel Orders page.

## Test Environment

- **Frontend Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Backend Server**: Expected on http://localhost:5001
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright v1.52.0
- **Browsers Tested**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari

## Issues Identified

### 1. Connection Issues

- **Description**: Tests are failing with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors when trying to connect to the application.
- **Root Cause**: The Playwright configuration was set to use port 3001 (`baseURL: 'http://localhost:3001'`) while the development server is running on port 3000.
- **Solution**: Updated the `playwright.config.ts` file to use the correct port: `baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000'`.

### 2. Authentication Flow

- **Description**: Tests are failing due to timeout when trying to login to the application.
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Selectors in the test don't match the actual elements in the login page
  - The auth.ts utility is using data-testid attributes that might not exist
  - Email/password combination may not be valid
- **Debugging Steps**:
  - Created a simplified debug test that captures screenshots to examine the login page
  - Added more robust selector fallbacks to try multiple ways of finding form inputs
  - Adjusted the login credentials to match what's likely in the development environment

### 3. Test Stability

- **Description**: Tests are fragile and fail intermittently.
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Reliance on exact selectors without fallbacks
  - Lack of proper waiting mechanisms for page transitions and API calls
  - Tests might be running too fast for the application to respond
- **Solution**: 
  - Added more robust selectors with multiple fallback strategies
  - Implemented proper waiting for navigation and element visibility
  - Added better error handling with screenshots for debugging

### 4. Test Environment Setup

- **Description**: The test environment is not properly set up before tests run.
- **Root Cause**: The development server needs to be started before running tests, and test users need to be created.
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced the `run-browser-tests.sh` script to check if the server is running and start it if needed
  - Added logic to create test users or mock the authentication process

## Recommendations

### 1. Improve Test Stability

- **Implementation**: 
  - Use more resilient selectors (by role, label, or text content rather than test-ids)
  - Add appropriate waiting mechanisms for all asynchronous operations
  - Create fixtures for common operations like login
  - Implement proper test isolation to prevent test interdependence

```typescript
// Example of more resilient selectors
// Instead of:
await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');

// Use:
await page.getByRole('button', { name: /log in|sign in/i }).click();
```

### 2. Implement Proper Authentication Handling

- **Implementation**:
  - Create a dedicated test user in the backend that doesn't change
  - Consider implementing test-specific auth bypass for faster tests
  - Use Playwright's storage state to save and reuse authentication tokens

```typescript
// Example of auth state reuse
const authFile = 'playwright/.auth/admin.json';

// Setup auth state
test('authenticate as admin', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.getByLabel('Email').fill('admin@fbolaunchpad.com');
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('Admin123!');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /log in/i }).click();
  await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');
  
  // Save storage state
  await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile });
});

// Reuse auth state
test.use({ storageState: authFile });
```

### 3. Setup Test Data

- **Implementation**:
  - Create a test environment with predictable data
  - Use API calls to set up test data instead of UI interactions where possible
  - Implement cleanup routines to reset the system after tests

### 4. Implement Visual Regression Testing

- **Implementation**:
  - Use Playwright's snapshot feature to capture and compare visual elements
  - Set up baseline snapshots for key UI components
  - Implement mechanisms to update snapshots when UI changes intentionally

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Base Configuration**:
   - Ensure the correct baseURL in playwright.config.ts
   - Update all browser configurations to match the application environment

2. **Improve Authentication Handling**:
   - Create a robust authentication utility
   - Implement storage state for faster tests

3. **Refactor Test Structure**:
   - Organize tests by feature area
   - Create reusable fixtures and helper functions
   - Implement proper test isolation

4. **Create Test Data Management**:
   - Develop scripts to set up and clean up test data
   - Create stable test environments with known data

## Conclusion

The end-to-end tests for the Fuel Orders page are currently failing due to connection issues, incorrect selectors, and authentication problems. By implementing the recommendations above, we can create a more stable and reliable test suite that provides confidence in the application's functionality.

The primary focus should be on fixing the authentication flow, as this is a prerequisite for all other tests. Once authentication is working reliably, we can build on that foundation to test the specific features of the Fuel Orders page.
