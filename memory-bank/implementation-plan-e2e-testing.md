# Implementation Plan: E2E Testing Improvements

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps to improve the end-to-end testing infrastructure for the FBO LaunchPad application, focusing on the Fuel Orders page. It addresses issues found during initial testing and provides a roadmap for creating a robust, reliable test suite.

## Phase 1: Fix Configuration and Setup

### 1.1 Update Playwright Configuration

- **Task**: Update `playwright.config.ts` to use the correct baseURL and browser settings
- **Implementation**:
  - Set `baseURL` to `http://localhost:3000`
  - Configure test timeouts appropriately
  - Optimize project settings for test performance
  - Enable videos and screenshots for failed tests
- **Status**: Completed - baseURL updated to correct port

### 1.2 Create Test Environment Setup Script

- **Task**: Enhance `run-browser-tests.sh` to properly set up the test environment
- **Implementation**:
  - Add checks for required services (frontend, backend)
  - Start services automatically if needed
  - Set up test user accounts or authentication bypass
  - Add cleanup routines after test completion
- **Status**: In Progress - Initial script created

### 1.3 Create Authentication Utilities

- **Task**: Develop robust authentication handling
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `.auth` directory for storing authentication states
  - Implement `auth.setup.ts` to create and save authentication states for different user roles
  - Update `auth.ts` utility to use more resilient selectors
  - Create `globalSetup.ts` for Playwright to handle authentication before tests run
- **Status**: In Progress - Initial auth.ts created, needs improvements

## Phase 2: Refactor Test Structure

### 2.1 Create Test Fixtures

- **Task**: Implement reusable fixtures for common test operations
- **Implementation**:
  - Create authenticated page fixtures for different user roles
  - Implement fixtures for accessing common UI components
  - Add fixtures for API operations and data setup
- **Status**: Not Started

### 2.2 Reorganize Test Files

- **Task**: Restructure test files for better organization
- **Implementation**:
  - Organize tests by feature area (auth, orders, admin, etc.)
  - Create model-based page objects for each major screen
  - Implement shared utilities for common operations
- **Status**: Not Started

### 2.3 Implement Test Isolation

- **Task**: Ensure tests are properly isolated and don't affect each other
- **Implementation**:
  - Use unique test data for each test
  - Reset application state between tests
  - Implement cleanup routines
- **Status**: Not Started

## Phase 3: Implement Core Feature Tests

### 3.1 Authentication Tests

- **Task**: Create tests for authentication flows
- **Implementation**:
  - Test login with various user roles
  - Test login failure scenarios
  - Test password reset flow
  - Test session management and timeout
- **Status**: Not Started

### 3.2 Fuel Orders Page Basic Tests

- **Task**: Test basic functionality of the Fuel Orders page
- **Implementation**:
  - Test page loading and table rendering
  - Test filtering and sorting functionality
  - Test pagination
  - Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- **Status**: Partially Complete - Tests created, but failing due to auth issues

### 3.3 Order Management Tests

- **Task**: Test order creation and management flows
- **Implementation**:
  - Test creating new orders
  - Test viewing order details
  - Test updating order status
  - Test role-specific actions
- **Status**: Partially Complete - Tests created, but failing due to auth issues

## Phase 4: Advanced Testing Features

### 4.1 Visual Regression Testing

- **Task**: Implement visual regression testing for key UI components
- **Implementation**:
  - Create baseline snapshots for important UI elements
  - Configure visual comparison thresholds
  - Set up workflow for updating snapshots
- **Status**: Not Started

### 4.2 Performance Testing

- **Task**: Add basic performance metrics to tests
- **Implementation**:
  - Measure page load times
  - Test responsiveness under different conditions
  - Implement performance budgets
- **Status**: Not Started

### 4.3 Accessibility Testing

- **Task**: Add accessibility tests for key pages
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate Playwright's accessibility testing tools
  - Test against WCAG standards
  - Report accessibility issues
- **Status**: Not Started

## Timeline and Priorities

1. **Immediate (Phase 1)**:
   - Fix configuration and authentication issues
   - Get basic tests running for the Fuel Orders page

2. **Short-term (Phase 2)**:
   - Refactor test structure for maintainability
   - Implement proper test isolation

3. **Medium-term (Phase 3)**:
   - Complete core feature tests for all critical functionality
   - Ensure tests are stable and reliable

4. **Long-term (Phase 4)**:
   - Implement advanced testing features
   - Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to improving the end-to-end testing infrastructure for the FBO LaunchPad application. By addressing the current issues and implementing a more robust testing framework, we can create reliable tests that provide confidence in the application's functionality and help catch regressions early in the development process.
