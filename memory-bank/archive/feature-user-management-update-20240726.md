# Task Archive: User Management System Update: Implement Edit and Delete Functionality

## Metadata
- **Complexity**: Level 3
- **Type**: Feature
- **Date Completed**: 2024-07-26
- **Related Tasks**: User Management Admin Interface

## Summary
This task enhanced the Admin User Management system to allow administrators to edit existing user details (name, email, active status, roles) and to deactivate/activate users (implementing a soft delete via the `is_active` flag). The implementation involved backend API changes (services, routes, schemas) and corresponding frontend updates (services, components, pages) to support these new capabilities.

## Requirements
- Allow administrators with appropriate permissions to edit user details: name, email, roles, active status.
- Allow administrators to deactivate (soft delete) and reactivate users.
- Prevent users from deactivating their own accounts or removing their own admin/management capabilities through these UI actions.
- Update frontend UI to provide an intuitive interface for these actions.

## Implementation

### Approach
- **Backend**: Modified `UserService` to handle update logic (including email uniqueness, self-update prevention) and soft-delete logic. Updated `UserUpdateRequestSchema`. Implemented/Verified `PATCH /api/admin/users/<id>` and `DELETE /api/admin/users/<id>` (for deactivation) routes in `user_admin_routes.py`.
- **Frontend**: Updated `UserService.js` with `updateUser` and `deleteUser` (for deactivation) methods. Modified `UserForm.jsx` to support editing and include the email field. Revamped `UserManagementPage.jsx` to replace a direct delete with an activate/deactivate toggle mechanism, using the `updateUser` service call.
- **Error Handling**: Addressed a CORS issue (which was masking a backend 500 error) and fixed a backend `AttributeError` related to a service method name. Frontend import issues (default vs. named exports) were also resolved.

### Key Components & Files Changed

**Backend (`fbo-launchpad-backend`):**
- `src/services/user_service.py`: Major logic changes for `update_user`, `delete_user`.
- `src/routes/admin/user_admin_routes.py`: Ensured `PATCH` and `DELETE` routes for users were correctly implemented and calling the service layer. Corrected a call from `get_all_users` to `get_users`.
- `src/schemas/user_schemas.py`: Added `email` to `UserUpdateRequestSchema`.
- `src/seeds.py`: Verified permissions; identified that `'EDIT_USER'` was not a defined permission, leading to use of `'MANAGE_USERS'` on frontend.

**Frontend (`fbo-launchpad-frontend-csr`):**
- `src/services/UserService.js`: Added `updateUser`, `deleteUser` (for deactivation); changed to named exports.
- `src/pages/admin/UserManagementPage.jsx`: Replaced delete button with activate/deactivate toggle; updated permission checks to `MANAGE_USERS`; updated to use named imports from `UserService.js`.
- `src/components/admin/UserForm.jsx`: Modified to include `email` field and correctly populate for editing (manual diff applied).
- `src/pages/OrderCreatePage.jsx`: Updated to use named imports from `UserService.js`.
- `src/components/layout/AdminTabBar.jsx`: Tab bar effectively removed by returning `null` to address a duplicate menu issue.

## Creative Phase Decisions
- UI/UX design decisions were documented in `memory-bank/creative-uiux-design.md`.
- Key decisions included using a modal for user editing and providing clear activate/deactivate actions.
- Some UI polish (custom dialogs/snackbars) was deferred.

## Testing
- Manual QA was performed during development, identifying issues like missing action buttons (due to incorrect permission checks) and CORS/backend errors.
- The original plan included more formal automated testing (backend unit/integration, frontend component/integration), which was not executed during this interactive session and remains as a follow-up.

## Lessons Learned
- **Tooling Limitations**: Automated code editing tools showed limitations with complex files and markdown checklists, highlighting the need for robust manual verification or alternative approaches (like AI providing diffs).
- **Error Chaining**: CORS errors can mask underlying backend application errors. Always investigate backend logs thoroughly when such combinations occur.
- **Permissions & Seeding**: Frontend permission checks must align *exactly* with backend permission definitions. Seeding scripts are critical for ensuring the correct permissions are in the database.
- **Iterative Development**: Deferring non-critical UI polish (e.g., custom dialogs) can be a valid strategy to maintain momentum on core functionality, provided it's tracked as technical debt.
- **Clear Communication (AI/User)**: When AI tools fail repeatedly (e.g., file edits), clear communication and pivoting to alternative methods (manual diffs) is important.

## Future Considerations
- Complete comprehensive automated testing (backend and frontend).
- Implement the planned `AlertSnackbar.jsx` and `ConfirmDialog.jsx` for improved user experience.
- Update API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Create/update end-user documentation for administrators.
