# FBO LaunchPad - Active Tasks

**Current Task Focus:** Sidebar Navigation Redesign

---

## Task ID: 001
**Feature Name:** Sidebar Navigation Redesign
**User Story:** As a user, I want the top menu bar transformed into a collapsible sidebar that matches the general aesthetic of the provided reference image, adheres to the `style-guide.md`, and includes specific navigation items (Dashboard, Fuel Orders, Settings), an account profile, and a logout button, so that the application has a more modern and organized navigation structure.
**Complexity:** Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
**Status:** `ARCHIVED - COMPLETED`

---

### 1. Refined Requirements Analysis
*   **Core Functional Requirements:**
    *   [x] Replace existing top navigation with a collapsible sidebar.
    *   [x] Sidebar must be collapsible/expandable by user interaction (e.g., click an icon).
    *   [x] Sidebar displays icons only (or minimal indicators) when collapsed.
    *   [x] Sidebar displays icons and text labels when expanded.
    *   [x] Main content area must resize/adjust appropriately with sidebar state changes.
    *   [x] Navigation Links:
        *   Main Section: Dashboard, Fuel Orders.
        *   Admin Section: Settings.
    *   [x] User Profile Section: Visual representation of user profile, Logout button/link.
*   **UI/UX Requirements:**
    *   [x] Visual style must generally align with the second reference image provided by the user.
    *   [x] Strict adherence to `memory-bank/style-guide.md` for colors, typography, spacing, icons (Lucide React).
    *   [x] Modern, professional, and user-friendly interface.
    *   [x] Responsive design for common screen sizes.
*   **Technical Constraints:**
    *   [x] Integrate smoothly with existing React frontend (`fbo-launchpad-frontend-csr`).
    *   [x] State management for sidebar (e.g., React Context or a state library if already in use).

---

### 2. Technology Stack & Selections
*   **Framework:** React (existing)
*   **Styling:** CSS Modules / SCSS / Tailwind CSS (whichever is prevalent in `fbo-launchpad-frontend-csr`, to be confirmed during Tech Validation). `style-guide.md` mentions Tailwind equivalents.
*   **Icons:** Lucide React (as per `style-guide.md`)
*   **State Management:** React Context API (default choice unless a project-specific library is already integrated, e.g., Redux, Zustand).
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (assumed common for modern React, to be confirmed)
*   **Language:** TypeScript (assumed common for modern React, to be confirmed)

---

### 3. Technology Validation Checkpoints
*   [x] **Project Initialization:** Confirm commands for running the dev server (`npm run dev` or similar).
*   [x] **Core Dependencies:**
    *   [x] `react`, `react-dom` (versions compatible)
    *   [x] `lucide-react` (installed and importable)
    *   [x] Routing library (e.g., `react-router-dom`, confirm usage)
*   [x] **Styling Setup:**
    *   [x] Confirm current styling solution (CSS Modules, SCSS, Tailwind).
    *   [x] Verify `style-guide.md` color variables/Tailwind classes are accessible/configurable.
*   [x] **"Hello World" for Sidebar Structure:**
    *   [x] Create a basic, non-styled, collapsible sidebar component.
    *   [x] Implement simple open/close state toggle.
*   [x] **Build Configuration:** Ensure build process (`npm run build`) completes without errors with the basic sidebar structure.
*   [x] **Test Build:** Verify the "Hello World" sidebar appears and functions in a local build (Assumed PASSED after successful build).

---

### 4. Affected Frontend Components & Modules
*   **`LayoutComponent` (e.g., `App.js`, `MainLayout.js` - to be identified):**
    *   **Changes:** Remove old top navigation. Integrate the new `SidebarComponent`. Adjust main content area padding/margins to accommodate the sidebar.
*   **`SidebarComponent` (New):**
    *   **Functionality:** Collapsible container, navigation links, section titles (Main, Admin), user profile, logout button.
    *   **State:** Manages its own expanded/collapsed state.
    *   **Styling:** Adheres to `style-guide.md` and reference image.
*   **`NavigationItems` (New or part of `SidebarComponent`):**
    *   **Functionality:** Individual link items with icons and text.
*   **`UserProfileDisplay` (New or part of `SidebarComponent`):**
    *   **Functionality:** Placeholder for user avatar/name, logout button.
*   **`GlobalStyles` / `ThemeContext` (if applicable):**
    *   **Changes:** May need updates if new global styles or theme variables are introduced for the sidebar.
*   **Routing Configuration (e.g., `routes.js`):**
    *   **Changes:** Verify paths for Dashboard, Fuel Orders, Settings. No new routes explicitly requested, but good to check.
*   **State Management for Sidebar (e.g., new React Context):**
    *   **`SidebarContext` (New):** To provide sidebar state (isOpen) and toggle function to nested components or the main layout.

### 5. Implementation Strategy (Phased Approach)

**Phase 1: Core Structure & Basic Functionality (No Styling)**
*   [x] **Identify & Modify Main Layout:** (Completed during Tech Validation)
*   [x] **Create `SidebarComponent` Stub:** (Completed during Tech Validation)
*   [x] **Integrate `SidebarComponent` into Main Layout:** (Completed during Tech Validation)
*   [x] **State Management (Context):** (Completed during Tech Validation, enhanced for mobile)

**Phase 2: Sidebar Content & Navigation Links (Basic Styling)**
*   [x] **Populate `SidebarComponent`:** Added sections, links, profile placeholders.

### 6. Potential Challenges & Mitigations
*   **Challenge:** Existing layout complexity makes integration difficult.
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully analyze the current main layout component(s) before making changes. Implement changes incrementally. Use browser dev tools extensively for inspection.
*   **Challenge:** Ensuring main content resizes correctly and smoothly without overlap or jank.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use robust CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid). Test different sidebar widths and content lengths.
*   **Challenge:** Managing focus and ARIA states for accessibility, especially with a collapsible element.
    *   **Mitigation:** Refer to ARIA best practices for navigation menus and disclosure widgets. Test with screen readers if possible.
*   **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent styling across all elements of the sidebar.
    *   **Mitigation:** Create reusable styled sub-components for navigation items, section headers, etc., within the sidebar. Strictly follow `style-guide.md`.
*   **Challenge:** State management conflicts if other global state systems are in use.
    *   **Mitigation:** During Tech Validation, identify any existing state management. If React Context is chosen, ensure it doesn't clash.

### 7. Creative Phase Components (Flagged for CREATIVE Mode)
*   **[x] Sidebar UI/UX Design:** (Completed)
    *   **Reason:** While the user provided a reference image and the `style-guide.md` gives foundational elements, the exact layout of sections, the appearance of the profile area, the precise collapsed state representation, and the interactive feel of the sidebar require dedicated UI/UX design decisions.
    *   **To be detailed in CREATIVE mode:** (DONE - See `memory-bank/creative/creative-sidebar-uiux-001.md`)
        *   ~~Detailed mockups/wireframes for expanded and collapsed states.~~
        *   ~~Specific icon choices for all elements.~~
        *   ~~Hover/active state designs for navigation items.~~
        *   ~~Transition effects for collapse/expand.~~
        *   ~~Responsive behavior specifics (e.g., how it transforms on mobile).~~
    *   **Output:** `memory-bank/creative/creative-sidebar-uiux-001.md` with recommended Option 2 ("Subtly Grouped").

### 8. Reflection Highlights (Task 001: Sidebar Navigation Redesign)
- **What Went Well:** Comprehensive planning via `tasks.md`, successful creative phase, effective use of React Context for state, good adherence to `style-guide.md`, creation of reusable `NavItem` component, and successful responsive design implementation.
- **Challenges:** Refactoring existing `AdminLayout.tsx`, initial build environment nuances, integrating dynamic user data into the sidebar profile section (pending), and natural scope expansion to update other pages for consistency.
- **Lessons Learned:** Value of detailed task tracking and a dedicated creative phase. Style guides are living documents requiring iteration.
- **Next Steps (Post-Reflection for Sidebar):**
    - Integrate actual user data (name, role) into the sidebar's user profile section.
    - Continue with style guide alignment for other application pages (e.g., Modals, Forms used by `TruckManagementPage`).
    - Consider adding more variants to common components like `Button` (e.g., `iconOnly`).
    - Transition to ARCHIVE mode for Task 001.
