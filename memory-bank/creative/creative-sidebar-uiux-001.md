# üé® CREATIVE PHASE: UI/UX Design - New Collapsible Sidebar

**Task ID:** 001
**Feature Name:** Sidebar Navigation Redesign
**Date:** May 14, 2025

---

## 1. üéØ PROBLEM STATEMENT & USER NEEDS

**Problem:** The current top navigation bar is to be replaced with a more modern, space-efficient, and organized collapsible sidebar.
**User Goal:** Users need intuitive access to main application sections (Dashboard, Fuel Orders), admin settings, and their profile/logout options, with a clear visual hierarchy and a look that aligns with the provided reference image and the established `style-guide.md`.

**Key User Stories/Requirements (from `tasks.md`):**
*   Sidebar is collapsible (icon click).
*   Expanded: Shows icons and text labels.
*   Collapsed: Shows icons only (or minimal indicators).
*   Content:
    *   "Main" section: Dashboard, Fuel Orders.
    *   "Admin" section (further down): Settings.
    *   User Profile area (visual representation).
    *   Logout button.
*   Style: Adhere strictly to `memory-bank/style-guide.md`, general look of user's second image.
*   Responsive.

---

## 2. üßê INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE & CONTENT HIERARCHY

The sidebar content will be structured as follows:

1.  **Branding/Logo Area (Top - Optional but common)**
    *   Could display a compact version of the FBO LaunchPad logo.
2.  **Collapse/Expand Toggle Button**
    *   Clearly visible in both states.
3.  **Main Navigation Section ("MAIN")**
    *   Title: "MAIN" (Subtle, e.g., `style-guide.md` Caption or Tiny size, `Text Secondary` color)
    *   Link: Dashboard (Icon: e.g., `LayoutDashboard` from Lucide)
    *   Link: Fuel Orders (Icon: e.g., `Fuel` or `ListOrdered` from Lucide)
4.  **Admin Navigation Section ("ADMIN")**
    *   Title: "ADMIN" (Styled like "MAIN" title)
    *   Link: Settings (Icon: e.g., `Settings` or `SlidersHorizontal` from Lucide)
    *   *(This section will appear below "MAIN" items, potentially with a subtle divider if needed)*
5.  **Spacer (Flexible, pushes profile to bottom)**
6.  **User Profile & Logout Section (Bottom)**
    *   User Avatar (Placeholder if no image, initials)
    *   User Name/Role (e.g., `Body` or `Small` text size)
    *   Logout Button (Icon: e.g., `LogOut` from Lucide)

---

## 3. üé® UI/UX DESIGN OPTIONS EXPLORATION

We will explore a few options, focusing on the overall layout, interaction for collapse/expand, and the visual treatment of sections and items, all within the constraints of `style-guide.md`.

**Core Style Guide Elements to Apply (from `memory-bank/style-guide.md`):**
*   **Colors:**
    *   Sidebar Background: `neutral-surface` (Light: `#FFFFFF`, Dark: `#1E2124`)
    *   Borders/Dividers: `neutral-border` (Light: `#DEE2E6`, Dark: `#2D3339`)
    *   Text (Default): `neutral-text-primary`
    *   Text (Secondary/Muted for section titles): `neutral-text-secondary`
    *   Icons (Default): `neutral-text-secondary`
    *   Active Link Background: `primary-light`
    *   Active Link Text/Icon: `primary`
    *   Hover Link Background: `neutral-surface-hover` (Light) / `neutral-background-subtle` (Dark) or `primary-light` with lower opacity.
    *   Hover Link Text/Icon: `primary`
*   **Typography:** Montserrat, with sizes/weights from the scale (e.g., H3 for section titles if prominent, Body/Small for links).
*   **Spacing:** 4px grid (xs, sm, md, lg, xl for padding, margins, gaps).
*   **Border Radius:** `rounded-md` (6px) for interactive elements like links, `rounded-lg` (8px) for the sidebar itself if it has distinct borders.
*   **Icons:** Lucide React, sized `sm` (20px) or `md` (24px) for navigation.

---

### Option 1: "Classic Minimalist"

*   **Description:** A clean, straightforward approach. Sidebar has a subtle border. Sections are demarcated by small text headers. User profile is compact at the bottom.
*   **Layout (Expanded - approx 250-280px width):**
    *   Top: Small Logo (optional), Collapse Button (e.g., `ChevronLeft` icon).
    *   "MAIN" section title.
    *   Dashboard Link (Icon + Text).
    *   Fuel Orders Link (Icon + Text).
    *   Subtle full-width divider (`neutral-border`).
    *   "ADMIN" section title.
    *   Settings Link (Icon + Text).
    *   Flexible spacer.
    *   User Profile: Small Avatar, Name, Logout icon button.
*   **Layout (Collapsed - approx 60-70px width):**
    *   Top: Small Logo icon (if used), Expand Button (e.g., `ChevronRight` or `Menu` icon).
    *   Dashboard Icon.
    *   Fuel Orders Icon.
    *   Settings Icon.
    *   Flexible spacer.
    *   User Avatar (acts as profile indicator).
    *   Logout Icon.
    *   *(Tooltips on hover for icons in collapsed state is essential)*
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Collapse/Expand: Smooth width transition. Content next to sidebar resizes with `marginLeft` transition.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Very clean and aligns with modern minimalist trends.
    *   Easy to understand and use.
    *   Follows `style-guide.md` naturally.
*   **Cons:**
    *   May feel too bare if not executed with careful attention to spacing and typography.
    *   Section titles might be too subtle if not styled well.
*   **Style Guide Alignment:** High. Uses standard surface, border, and text colors. Spacing is key.

---

### Option 2: "Subtly Grouped"

*   **Description:** Similar to Option 1, but navigation items within sections have a slightly inset background on hover/active, visually grouping them more distinctly. The sidebar itself might not have a prominent right border, blending more with the page background, relying on its `neutral-surface` color for separation.
*   **Layout (Expanded):**
    *   Similar to Option 1, but active/hover states for links might use a full-width background color (`primary-light` for active, `neutral-surface-hover` for hover) that is slightly inset or padded within the main sidebar padding.
    *   Collapse Button: Could be a dedicated icon (`PanelLeftClose` / `PanelLeftOpen`).
*   **Layout (Collapsed):**
    *   Similar to Option 1. Icons align centrally.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Similar to Option 1.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Clearer visual grouping for active/hovered navigation items.
    *   Can feel more integrated if the outer border is removed or very subtle.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires careful padding and margin management to make inset backgrounds look good.
    *   If outer border is removed, needs good contrast between `neutral-surface` of sidebar and `neutral-background` of page.
*   **Style Guide Alignment:** High. Leverages `primary-light` and `neutral-surface-hover` effectively.

---

### Option 3: "Icon-Focused with Top Profile" (Closer to User's 2nd Image Inspiration)

*   **Description:** This option draws more from the "sidebar with icons and a profile at the top" general idea from the user's second image. The main difference is the profile section is at the top, below the logo/branding.
*   **Layout (Expanded):**
    *   Top: Logo/Brand Name, Collapse button.
    *   User Profile Section: Avatar, User Name, Role, Logout button (perhaps in a dropdown or less prominent).
    *   Divider.
    *   "MAIN" section (no explicit title, links directly):
        *   Dashboard (Icon + Text).
        *   Fuel Orders (Icon + Text).
    *   "ADMIN" section (no explicit title, links directly, possibly separated by a small visual gap or divider):
        *   Settings (Icon + Text).
*   **Layout (Collapsed):**
    *   Top: Logo icon, Expand Button.
    *   User Avatar.
    *   Divider.
    *   Dashboard Icon.
    *   Fuel Orders Icon.
    *   Settings Icon.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Collapse/Expand: Similar transition.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Profile is more prominent at the top.
    *   Can lead to a very clean list of navigation items if section titles are omitted.
    *   Potentially aligns more with the spirit of the reference image.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Placing Logout within a top profile section needs careful thought (e.g., not a primary button, maybe an icon within a dropdown from the profile name).
    *   Omitting section titles ("MAIN", "ADMIN") might reduce clarity slightly, though icons + context can suffice.
    *   A bit more deviation from a "standard" sidebar layout, but still very viable.
*   **Style Guide Alignment:** High. All elements will still use `style-guide.md` for their appearance. Structure is the main variant.

## 5. ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED APPROACH & RATIONALE

**Recommended: Option 2: "Subtly Grouped" with elements from Option 1.**

*   **Rationale:**
    *   Option 2 provides a very clean, modern look that aligns perfectly with the detailed `style-guide.md`.
    *   The "subtly grouped" active/hover states for navigation items offer a refined user experience by clearly highlighting the user's current location or focus. This is often better than just a text color change.
    *   It maintains the clear sectional organization (MAIN, ADMIN titles) from Option 1, which is good for scannability, especially as more items might be added later.
    *   The profile section at the bottom is a standard and non-intrusive placement, keeping navigation primary.
    *   It's highly adaptable for responsiveness.
    *   While Option 3 is closer to the reference image's *profile placement*, Option 2 better embodies the *overall professional and clean aesthetic* also present in that image, while being more scalable with explicit sections. We can ensure the "look and feel" matches the user's desire for a modern UI without copying the structure exactly.

**Key Characteristics of Recommended Design:**

*   **Overall Structure:**
    *   Sidebar Width: Expanded `~260px`, Collapsed `~68px` (to comfortably fit 24px icons + padding).
    *   Background: `neutral-surface`.
    *   Border: A single, subtle `1px` `neutral-border` on the right side of the sidebar.
*   **Top Area:**
    *   Optional: Compact FBO LaunchPad logo (if one exists that fits). If not, this area can be omitted or used just for the collapse toggle.
    *   Collapse/Expand Toggle: `ChevronLeft` (when open) / `Menu` or `ChevronRight` (when closed). Styled as an icon button. Placed at the top-right of the sidebar, or top-left if no logo.
*   **Navigation Sections ("MAIN", "ADMIN"):**
    *   Titles ("MAIN", "ADMIN"): `style-guide.md` Caption size (`13px`), `500` (Medium) weight, `neutral-text-secondary` color. Padded appropriately.
    *   Links:
        *   Layout: Flex row, icon + text. Padding `py-sm px-md` (e.g., 8px y, 16px x). `rounded-md`.
        *   Icon: Lucide icons, size `sm` (20px), color `neutral-text-secondary` by default.
        *   Text: `style-guide.md` Small size (`14px`), `400` (Regular) weight, `neutral-text-primary`.
        *   Hover State: Background `neutral-surface-hover`, Icon and Text color `primary`.
        *   Active State: Background `primary-light`, Icon and Text color `primary`. `font-weight: 500` (Medium).
*   **User Profile & Logout (Bottom):**
    *   Layout: Section at the bottom, separated by a subtle top border (`neutral-border`). Padded (`p-md`).
    *   Avatar: Placeholder (Initials or generic user icon), `rounded-full`, size e.g., `32px` or `40px`.
    *   User Info: Name (Small size, `neutral-text-primary`), Role (Tiny size, `neutral-text-secondary`). Stacked vertically next to avatar.
    *   Logout: Icon button (`LogOut` icon), `neutral-text-secondary` hover `status-error` color. Placed to the right of user info or below it.
*   **Collapsed State:**
    *   Only icons are visible, centered.
    *   Tooltips on icon hover are essential.
    *   Active item should still show its icon with `primary` color.
*   **Transitions:** Smooth `width` transition for the sidebar, and `marginLeft` for the main content area.

## 6. üìê IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES & DETAILS (for `Sidebar.jsx`)

*   **Main Container (`div`):**
    *   Tailwind: `fixed top-0 left-0 h-screen z-30 flex flex-col bg-neutral-surface text-neutral-text-primary border-r border-neutral-border transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`
    *   Width: Dynamic based on `isSidebarOpen` (e.g., `w-[260px]` or `w-[68px]`).
*   **Logo/Brand Area (Optional):**
    *   Tailwind: `px-md py-sm flex items-center justify-between` (if toggle is also here).
*   **Collapse Toggle Button:**
    *   Tailwind: `p-xs rounded-md hover:bg-neutral-surface-hover text-neutral-text-secondary hover:text-primary`. Icon inside.
*   **Navigation List (`nav` element):**
    *   Tailwind: `flex-1 flex flex-col gap-xs p-md` (adjust `gap` and `p` as needed).
*   **Section Titles (e.g., `h3` or `p`):**
    *   Tailwind: `px-md pt-md pb-xs text-caption font-medium text-neutral-text-secondary uppercase tracking-wider` (example).
*   **NavLink Items (`NavLink` from `react-router-dom`):**
    *   Tailwind (base): `flex items-center gap-md px-md py-sm rounded-md transition-colors text-sm-regular text-neutral-text-primary`.
    *   Tailwind (hover): `hover:bg-neutral-surface-hover hover:text-primary`.
    *   Tailwind (active - applied via NavLink's `isActive`): `bg-primary-light text-primary font-medium [&_svg]:text-primary`.
    *   Icon: `text-neutral-text-secondary` (will be overridden by active state).
    *   Text Span (for expanded): `truncate` if long. Hidden when collapsed.
*   **User Profile Section (div at bottom):**
    *   Tailwind: `p-md border-t border-neutral-border mt-auto`. Flex container.
    *   Avatar: `h-8 w-8 rounded-full bg-primary-light text-primary flex items-center justify-center text-sm-medium` (for initials).
    *   User Name: `text-sm-medium text-neutral-text-primary`.
    *   Logout Button: `ml-auto text-neutral-text-secondary hover:text-status-error p-xs rounded-md hover:bg-red-100/50`.
*   **Collapsed State Logic:**
    *   Use `isSidebarOpen` from context to conditionally apply classes for width, hiding text, centering icons.
    *   Example for hiding text: `isSidebarOpen ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0 w-0 overflow-hidden'` (with appropriate transitions). Or simply `isSidebarOpen ? 'inline' : 'hidden'`.

## 7. üñºÔ∏è VISUALIZATION (Conceptual Mockups/Sketches)

*(This section would typically include actual image mockups. For this text-based generation, I will describe them)*

**Expanded View (Light Mode):**
*   Sidebar on left, `260px` wide, white background (`#FFFFFF`), thin grey right border (`#DEE2E6`).
*   Top: `ChevronLeft` icon for collapse.
*   "MAIN" title in grey, small caps.
*   "Dashboard" link: Blue icon (`LayoutDashboard`), black text. Active state: light blue background (`#b9d9f5`), blue icon & text.
*   "Fuel Orders" link: Grey icon (`Fuel`), black text.
*   "ADMIN" title below.
*   "Settings" link: Grey icon (`Settings`), black text.
*   Bottom: Thin grey top border. User avatar (blue circle with "JD"), "John Doe" in black, "Administrator" in smaller grey. Red `LogOut` icon on hover.

**Collapsed View (Light Mode):**
*   Sidebar on left, `68px` wide, white background, thin grey right border.
*   Top: `Menu` icon for expand.
*   Centered icons: `LayoutDashboard` (blue if active), `Fuel`, `Settings`.
*   Bottom: User avatar icon. `LogOut` icon. (Tooltips on hover for all).

*(Dark mode versions would use the dark theme colors from `style-guide.md` as specified above, e.g., sidebar bg `#1E2124`, text `#F8FAFC`, primary `#4A82AF`)*

---

## 8. ‚úÖ VERIFICATION AGAINST REQUIREMENTS & PRINCIPLES

*   **Collapsible:** Yes, with clear toggle.
*   **Expanded/Collapsed States:** Defined with icon+text and icon-only.
*   **Content Sections:** MAIN, ADMIN, Profile/Logout all included.
*   **Style Guide Adherence:** Designed explicitly using colors, typography, spacing from `style-guide.md`.
*   **Reference Image Alignment:** Captures professional, clean aesthetic. Sectional organization preferred over exact structural match for scalability.
*   **Responsiveness:** Structure is simple and lends itself well to standard responsive patterns (e.g., hidden on mobile, toggle with hamburger).
*   **Accessibility:** Tooltips for collapsed icons are critical. Standard link/button semantics. Contrast ratios from style guide should be good.
*   **React/Tailwind Best Practices:** Design uses utility-first approach, standard component structure.
