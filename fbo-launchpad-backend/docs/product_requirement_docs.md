# FBO LaunchPad Backend Project Brief

## Project Overview
FBO LaunchPad is a comprehensive Fixed Base Operator (FBO) management system designed to streamline aircraft fueling operations. The backend provides a RESTful API that supports the core functionality of fuel order management, user authentication, and real-time status tracking.

## Core Requirements

### 1. User Management
- Support multiple user roles (CSR, LST, Admin)
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens
- Role-based access control for all operations
- User status tracking (active/inactive)

### 2. Fuel Order Management
- Complete fuel order lifecycle management
- Real-time status updates
- Meter reading validation
- Support for multiple fuel types
- Customer and aircraft tracking

### 3. Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Secure password handling
- CORS protection for frontend integration

### 4. API Design
- RESTful architecture
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Consistent error handling
- Pagination for list endpoints

## Technical Goals
1. Maintainable and modular codebase
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Clear API documentation
4. Scalable database design
5. Efficient query optimization

## Success Criteria
1. All API endpoints documented and tested
2. 90%+ test coverage
3. Sub-second response times for common operations
4. Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication
5. Successful integration with frontend application

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Response time < 1 second for 95% of requests
2. 99.9% uptime during operational hours
3. Support for concurrent users
4. Audit trail for all fuel operations
5. Backup and recovery procedures 

# Product Context

## Business Overview

FBO LaunchPad is a comprehensive Fixed Base Operator (FBO) management system designed to streamline aircraft fueling operations at airports. The system connects Customer Service Representatives (CSRs), Line Service Technicians (LSTs), and administrators in a seamless workflow for fuel order management.

## User Roles

### 1. Customer Service Representative (CSR)
- Primary point of contact for aircraft operators
- Creates and manages fuel orders
- Assigns orders to LSTs
- Reviews completed orders
- Manages customer relationships

### 2. Line Service Technician (LST)
- Executes fuel orders
- Updates order status in real-time
- Records fuel meter readings
- Ensures safety compliance
- Reports issues or concerns

### 3. Administrator
- Manages user accounts
- Oversees system operations
- Generates reports
- Configures system settings
- Monitors performance

## Core Workflows

### 1. Fuel Order Creation
```
Aircraft Arrival → CSR Creates Order → LST Assignment → Order Execution → Review
```

### 2. Order Execution
```
Order Receipt → Acknowledgment → En Route → Fueling → Completion → Review
```

### 3. User Management
```
User Creation → Role Assignment → Active Status → Access Control
```

## Business Rules

### 1. Order Management
- Only CSRs can create orders
- LSTs must acknowledge before starting
- Meter readings required for completion
- CSR review required for closure

### 2. User Access
- CSRs manage orders and assignments
- LSTs update order status and data
- Admins have full system access
- Inactive users cannot access system

### 3. Safety & Compliance
- Valid fuel truck assignment required
- Proper meter reading validation
- Complete order documentation
- Audit trail maintenance

## User Experience Goals

### 1. CSR Experience
- Quick order creation
- Clear LST availability status
- Real-time order tracking
- Efficient review process

### 2. LST Experience
- Clear order instructions
- Simple status updates
- Easy data entry
- Mobile-friendly interface

### 3. Admin Experience
- Comprehensive oversight
- Easy user management
- Clear reporting
- System configuration

## Integration Points

### 1. Frontend Application
- Real-time updates
- Responsive design
- Role-based views
- Error handling

### 2. Future Integrations
- Billing systems
- Aircraft tracking
- Weather services
- Maintenance systems

## Success Metrics

### 1. Operational
