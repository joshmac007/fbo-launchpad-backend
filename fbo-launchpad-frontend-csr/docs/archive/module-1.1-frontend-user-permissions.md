# Task Archive: Frontend User Permissions Fetch & Check

## Metadata
- **Complexity**: Level 2
- **Type**: Enhancement
- **Date Completed**: [Fill in actual date]
- **Related Tasks**: Module 1.1, Backend GET /api/auth/me/permissions

## Summary
This task implemented robust user permissions management in the frontend. The AuthContext was enhanced to fetch and store the authenticated user's permissions from the backend, and a `hasPermission(permissionName)` helper was provided for components to check permissions declaratively. Permissions are now fetched after login and on initial load if authenticated, and cleared on logout, ensuring consistent and secure access control throughout the app.

## Requirements
- Fetch the current user's permissions from `/api/auth/me/permissions`.
- Store permissions in AuthContext and expose them to all components.
- Provide a `hasPermission(permissionName)` helper for permission checks.
- Fetch permissions after login and on initial load if authenticated.
- Clear permissions on logout.

## Implementation
### Approach
- Added `getMyPermissions` to `AuthService.js` to call the backend endpoint and return the permissions array.
- Updated `AuthContext.jsx` to:
  - Add `permissions` state and a `fetchUserPermissions` function.
  - Fetch permissions after login and on initial load if a valid token exists.
  - Clear permissions on logout.
  - Expose `permissions` and `hasPermission` in the context value.
  - Handle loading state to prevent premature permission checks.

### Key Components
- **AuthService.js**: Handles API call to fetch permissions.
- **AuthContext.jsx**: Manages authentication and permissions state, exposes permission helpers.

### Files Changed
- `src/services/authService.js`: Added `getMyPermissions`.
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`: Added/updated permissions logic and helpers.

## Testing
- Manual testing: Verified that permissions are fetched and available after login and on reload.
- Confirmed that `hasPermission` returns correct results for various permission scenarios.
- Verified that permissions are cleared on logout.
- Observed correct UI behavior when permissions are loading.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralizing permission logic in context simplifies management and reduces duplication.
- Handling async state and loading is critical for secure and predictable UI behavior.
- File name casing issues can cause subtle cross-platform bugs; always standardize import paths.

## Future Considerations
- Add automated tests for permission-based UI logic and edge cases.
- Document permission requirements for all major app features.
- Monitor for regressions in permission handling as new features are added.
