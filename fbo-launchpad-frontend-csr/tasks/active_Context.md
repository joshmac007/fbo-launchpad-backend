# Active Context Update (Module 1.1)
- Module 1.1 (Frontend: User Permissions Fetch & Check) and PBAC UI adaptation are fully complete.
- All UI elements (buttons, links, menu items) now use hasPermission from AuthContext for dynamic rendering based on user permissions.
- Reflection and archiving are done. See reflection.md for details.
- Context is ready for the next task or mode transition.
- AuthContext manages user permissions state and exposes hasPermission helper.
- Permissions are fetched after login and on initial load if authenticated.
- Permissions are cleared on logout.
- All components can check permissions via useAuth().
