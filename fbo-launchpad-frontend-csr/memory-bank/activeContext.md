# Active Context

## Current Development Focus
- CSR Dashboard implementation
- Real-time order tracking
- Frontend-backend integration

## Recent Changes and Learnings

### Dashboard Component Migration (2024-03-26)
1. **Component Replacement Strategy**
   - MISCONCEPTION: Initially attempted to add new Dashboard component alongside existing implementation
   - RESOLUTION: Needed to completely replace old implementation in DashboardPage
   - LEARNING: When replacing core functionality, ensure clean transition rather than parallel implementation

2. **Routing Structure Understanding**
   - MISCONCEPTION: Assumed MainLayout children prop was correct approach
   - RESOLUTION: Updated to use react-router-dom's `Outlet` component
   - LEARNING: In React Router v6, nested routes require `Outlet` for child route rendering

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Previous: Complex state management in DashboardPage
   - Current: Moved to modular components with clear responsibilities
   - Benefits: Better separation of concerns, improved maintainability

### Implementation Details
1. **Component Structure**
   ```
   DashboardPage
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dashboard
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OrderStatusCard (x3)
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FuelOrdersTable
   ```

2. **State Management**
   - Moved from page-level to component-level state
   - Implemented custom hooks for data fetching
   - Centralized order status tracking

3. **UI Components**
   - Created reusable status cards
   - Implemented responsive table layout
   - Added consistent loading states

### Current Technical Decisions
1. **Component Architecture**
   - Using functional components with TypeScript
   - Implementing custom hooks for data fetching
   - Following atomic design principles

2. **State Management**
   - React hooks for local state
   - Custom hooks for shared logic
   - JWT token in localStorage
   - Real-time updates via API polling

3. **UI/UX Patterns**
   - Consistent color scheme for status indicators
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Clear loading and error states
   - Intuitive action buttons

## Important Notes for Other AI Agents
1. **Component Replacement**
   - When implementing new versions of existing components:
     - Don't try to maintain both versions
     - Ensure clean replacement strategy
     - Update all related components and routes
     - Verify proper cleanup of old implementation

2. **React Router v6 Patterns**
   - Always use `Outlet` for nested routes
   - Don't use children prop in layout components
   - Maintain proper route hierarchy
   - Protected routes should wrap layout components

3. **State Management**
   - Prefer component-level state when possible
   - Use custom hooks for shared logic
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Consider data fetching patterns

4. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
   - Don't mix old and new implementations
   - Don't assume children prop for route-based layouts
   - Don't duplicate state management
   - Don't skip proper component hierarchy

## Next Steps
1. Implement order filtering and sorting
2. Add pagination to orders table
3. Enhance error handling
4. Add loading skeletons
5. Implement real-time updates

## Current Issues
1. Need to verify API integration
2. Consider implementing websockets
3. Add proper error boundaries
4. Enhance loading states

## Development Notes
- Run npm commands from frontend directory
- Ensure proper route protection
- Maintain consistent state management
- Follow established component patterns

## Active Decisions
1. Component Architecture
   - Using functional components with TypeScript
   - Implementing custom hooks for data fetching
   - Utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Following atomic design principles

2. State Management
   - Using React hooks for local state
   - Implementing custom hooks for shared logic
   - JWT token stored in localStorage
   - Real-time updates through API polling

3. UI/UX Patterns
   - Consistent color scheme for status indicators
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Loading states and error messages
   - Action buttons with clear visual hierarchy

## Current Considerations
1. Performance
   - Monitoring API response times
   - Optimizing component re-renders
   - Implementing proper loading states
   - Considering pagination for large datasets

2. Security
   - JWT token management
   - API endpoint protection
   - Input validation
   - Error handling

3. User Experience
   - Clear status indicators
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Responsive feedback
   - Accessible design

## Project Insights
1. Component Organization
   - Separate concerns between presentation and logic
   - Reusable components for common patterns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Clear component hierarchy

2. Data Flow
   - API integration through custom hooks
   - Centralized error handling
   - Consistent data transformation
   - Type safety with TypeScript

3. Development Patterns
   - Component-first development
   - Test-driven development (planned)
   - Consistent code style
   - Documentation-driven development

### Frontend Styling and UI Implementation
1. **Tailwind CSS Setup - IN PROGRESS**
   - ‚úÖ Installed required dependencies (postcss-import, postcss-nesting)
   - ‚úÖ Updated PostCSS configuration
   - ‚ùå Styles not applying correctly - investigating root cause
   - üîÑ Need to verify build process and style processing
   - üîÑ Need to check style injection in development
   - üîÑ Need to verify Vite configuration

### Current Issues
1. **Styling Not Applying**
   - Styles defined but not visible in the UI
   - PostCSS plugins installed and configured
   - Build process may need investigation
   - Vite configuration may need review
   - Style injection in development mode needs verification

### Development Notes
- Run npm commands from frontend directory (`fbo-launchpad-frontend-csr`)
- PostCSS configuration updated to use proper plugins
- Using postcss-nesting for CSS nesting support
- Using postcss-import for proper CSS imports
- Config files use ES module syntax
- Need to investigate why styles aren't being applied despite proper configuration

### Next Steps
1. Investigate why styles aren't applying:
   - Check Vite's style handling configuration
   - Verify style injection in development mode
   - Review build process for CSS
   - Check for style conflicts or overrides
   - Verify correct loading order of styles

2. Once styles are working:
   - Complete component styling migration
   - Implement responsive design
   - Add loading states
   - Enhance error handling
